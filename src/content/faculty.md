## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor at the [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) in the Indian Institute of Science Bengaluru.

Before this, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Learning and Autonomous Control group](https://lair-cor.github.io/) at the department of Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft. I earned my Ph.D. in [Control & Automation](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/control-and-automation), from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.

My research has contributed towards skill learning and optimal control for intelligent robots. I am a recipient of the DAAD Postdoc networking fellowship for AI and Robotics, with funded research visits to the German Aerospace Center (DLR), Munich.

My current research interests include learning complex manipulation policies from human demonstration/corrections, bimanual robot manipulation, task generalization in a novel environment, and human-friendly safe compliant control.

I have founded and direct the [Human-interactive Robotics Lab](https://iisc-hiro.github.io/) at the Indian Institute of Science.
